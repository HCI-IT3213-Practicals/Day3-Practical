# Day 03 Practical Sessions - Calculator App Development (Part 2) üî¢

Welcome to the **Calculator App Project** repository! This project showcases the step-by-step development of a fully functional calculator app using **Axure RP 9**. Each week, new features and interactions will be added to gradually build the app until it is fully functional.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a fully functional calculator app with an intuitive, user-friendly interface and interactive features. We are using **Axure RP 9** to design the interface and define interactions. This repository will be updated to reflect the latest progress in the development process.

### **What's New in Day 03**:
- **Improved the previous week's calculator**: Enhanced the functionality and interface from the previous week‚Äôs version.
- **Fully Created "AC", "+/-", "%" functions**: Implemented the "AC" (Clear), "+/-" (Negate), and "%" (Percentage) functions in the calculator.
- **Basic Operations Implemented**: Basic arithmetic operations like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` were partially implemented.

## üîß Features Implemented in Day 02

### **Basic Calculator Interface** üñ•Ô∏è
- Created a simple calculator layout with a screen and number pad (0-9).
- Buttons for numbers (0-9) were added.
- Future sessions will implement the advanced arithmetic operations and additional functionality.

### **Number Pad Interactions** üßÆ
- Interactions were created to update the calculator screen when a number is clicked.
  
### **Two Variables Introduced**:
- **Flag**: Determines whether the input should replace the existing value or append to it.
- **Saved Number**: Used to store the current input value.

### **Initial Variable Setup**:
- On page load, the following initial setups are done:
  - **Flag** is set to `"Replace"`.
  - **Saved Number** is set to an empty string `("")`.

### **Interaction Logic for Numbers (1-9)**:
- **If Flag equals "Replace"**:
  - Set the calculator screen text to the clicked number.
  - Set **Flag** to `"Join"`.
- **If Flag equals "Join"**:
  - Append the clicked number to the existing value on the screen.

### **Interaction Logic for Number 0**:
- **If Flag equals "Replace"**:
  - Set the calculator screen text to `"0"`.
- **If Flag equals "Join"**:
  - Append the number `"0"` to the existing value on the screen.

## üìÇ Files Included

- **Axure source files** (`Calculator.rp`).

---

## üìù To Be Completed

- **Complex +, -, *, / operations**: Full functionality for complex arithmetic operations will be added in the next sessions.

---

### **New Features**:
- **AC (All Clear) Button**: Clears the screen and resets the calculator to the initial state.
  - **Output**: After clicking "AC", the screen is reset to "0" and all stored values are cleared.

- **+/- (Negate) Button**: Switches the sign of the number on the screen from positive to negative or vice versa.
  - **Output**: After clicking "+/-", the displayed value's sign is flipped. For example, "5" becomes "-5".

- **% (Percentage) Button**: Converts the current value on the screen to a percentage.
  - **Output**: After clicking "%", the value on the screen is divided by 100. For example, "50" becomes "0.5".
